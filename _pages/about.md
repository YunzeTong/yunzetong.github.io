  Hi, I’m Yunze Tong, a third-year PhD student at Zhejiang University in Professor [Fei Wu](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=XJLn4MYAAAAJ&hl=en)'s group.

  My current research focuses on flow matching and diffusion models, specifically across two directions:

  1. Reinforcement Learning for Generative Models: Leveraging RL to enhance denoising performance by optimizing both the denoising trajectory and the initial noise distribution.
  2. Guided Generation: Integrating auxiliary priors, external models, and agents to further refine and guide generative processes.

  In the earlier stages of my PhD, I also worked on model interpretability (specifically SHAP and its variants) and Out-of-Distribution (OOD) generalization, with a focus on covariate shift.

  I earned my Bachelor’s degree from Zhejiang University in 2023 under the supervision of Professor Kun Kuang. During my studies, I also had the opportunity to work with Professor [Jun Xiao](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=fqOwFhQAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN).

  I am always open to academic discussions—please feel free to reach out!
